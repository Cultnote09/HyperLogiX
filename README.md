# AI-powered Logistics Dashboard

## Project Overview

The AI-powered Logistics Dashboard is a real-time, data-driven platform designed to optimize logistics, transportation, consignment monitoring, and warehouse operations. By integrating AI-powered analytics and Google Gemini, the dashboard enables live tracking of vehicles, drones, and warehouse inventory. It also provides a detailed insight into consignments, including real-time tracking, environmental data, and delivery status. This system is designed to enhance operational efficiency and ensure cost-effective, time-efficient logistics management.

## Features

- **Real-Time Tracking:** Live tracking of vehicles (trucks and drones) and warehouses using an interactive map.
- **Consignment Monitoring:** Detailed information about consignments, including tracking, route history, IoT sensor data (e.g., temperature, humidity), and payment status.
- **AI-powered Insights:** Query system powered by **Google Gemini AI** for real-time answers about consignment status, ETA, and more.
- **Predictive Analytics:** AI-driven analytics to optimize routes based on real-time data, such as traffic, weather, and geopolitical risks.
- **Fleet Optimization:** Real-time monitoring of fleet performance with key metrics like fuel consumption, COâ‚‚ emissions, and delivery accuracy.
- **Blockchain Integration:** Tamper-proof tracking for authenticity and regulatory compliance.
- **Mobile Support:** Multi-device access for logistics managers through web and mobile apps.
